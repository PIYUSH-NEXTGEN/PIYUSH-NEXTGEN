## 🚀 What I'm Actually Doing

Currently wrestling with **Data Structures & Algorithms** while building real projects that break constantly. No fluff, no "planning to learn" - just code, debug, repeat.

### 🔨 Active Projects
- **[Project Name Here]** - Brief one-line description of what it does
- **[Learning Repository]** - Daily problem-solving with brutal honesty about failures
- *(Add your actual projects or create them)*

## 💻 Tech I Actually Use

```python
current_stack = {
    "languages": ["Python", "C++"],
    "learning_through": ["LeetCode grinding", "Breaking things in VS Code"],
    "next_challenge": "Building something that matters",
    "reality_check": "More bugs than features"
}
```

## 📊 The Brutal Truth

**Contribution Graph Says It All:** Those gaps? Life happened. Those spikes? Burst motivation. The goal? Make the graph boring by coding consistently.

## 🎯 Current Focus

**Stop collecting technologies, start building things.**

- ✅ Solving DSA problems daily (even the ones that destroy my ego)
- 🔄 Building [specific project name] - currently 30% working, 70% debugging
- 📚 Reading others' code to understand why mine sucks
- 🤝 Actually engaging with dev communities instead of just lurking

---

## 🔗 Connect & Collaborate

I'm learning in public. If you spot terrible code in my repos, that's intentional transparency. Open to:
- Code reviews (be harsh)
- Project collaborations
- Learning together

## 💡 Philosophy

```javascript
while (alive) {
    eat();
    code();
    break_things();
    learn_from_failures();
    repeat();
}
```

**Reality over Resume.** I'd rather show you a messy project I actually built than a polished list of technologies I'm "planning to learn."
