## 🚀 What I'm Actually Doing

Currently wrestling with **Data Structures & Algorithms** while building real projects. - just code, debug, repeat.

### 🔨 Active Projects
- **[Image data analyzer]** - 

## 💻 Tech I Actually Use

```python
current_stack = {
    "languages": ["Python", "C++"],
    "learning_through": ["LeetCode grinding", "Breaking things in VS Code and Pycharm"],
```

**Contribution Graph Says It All:** Those gaps? Life happened. Those spikes? Burst motivation. The goal? Make the graph boring by coding consistently.

## 🎯 Current Focus

**Stop collecting technologies, start building things.**

-  Solving DSA problems daily
-  Building [Image data analytics] 
- Engaging with dev communities

## 🔗 Connect & Collaborate

I'm learning in public. If you spot terrible code in my repos, that's intentional transparency. Open to:
- Code reviews (be harsh)
- Project collaborations
- Learning together
